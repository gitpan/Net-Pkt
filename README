Tested ok against (only x86 architectures supported for now):
FreeBSD 5.2.1
OpenBSD 3.2
Linux 2.4 (Red Hat 7.2 with RPM updates)

Net::Pkt version 0.24
====================

This module is a unified framework to craft, send and receive packets at layers 
2, 3, 4 and 7 (but 4 and 7 are just here for completeness, they have not been 
thoroughly tested. And you should use IO::Socket for layer 7, anyway).

Basically, you forge each layer of a frame (Net::Pkt::LayerIPv4 for layer 3, 
Net::Pkt::LayerTCP for layer 4 ; for example), and pack all of this into a 
Net::Pkt::Frame object. Then, you can write it to the network, and use 
Net::Pkt::Dump to receive responses.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Perl v5.6.1
  Net::Pcap
  IO::Interface
  Time::HiRes
  libpcap

LIMITATIONS

If auto* subs do not work, you will need to set $Net::Pkt::Dev, $Net::Pkt::Ip, 
$Net::Pkt::Mac globals manually for each of your Net::Pkt programs.

Performances (memory usage, object creation speed) maye be quite limited for 
now. I will work on it in the near (or not) future.
