For next version:

Unknown (to be implemented one day - or not):
- headerLength should be called layerLength
- open Desc in safe mode (drop priv to $USER)
- remove Net::Pcap dependance ? we already must include -lpcap, so ...
- make test
- analyzeWithFilter, useful when analyzing a pcap file generated from elsewhere
- Dump->analyze should be auto-done when first access to $dump->frames
- Desc.pm should be an IO::Handle (need to tie ?)
- use Tie to access .pcap file ? (see Tie::MmapArray)
- put libnetpkt.c into only a .xs :)
- overloading: print $pkt => "IP: ... TCP: ..."
- overloading: use + overloading to ->pack each Layer into final raw
  => LayerIP_obj + LayerTCP_OBJ
- be able to send many packets to different dst
- TCP reassembly
- IP reassembly
- be able to connect to RA (ramon et al.)
- be able to clone a packet, and change some fields, and reAssemble all to send
  => see $ua->clone in LWP::UserAgent
- LayerIPv6, LayerICMPv6
- nochecksum option
- better handling of ip and tcp options

0.2x:
- Quick made hping-like
- LayerICMPv4 to continue

0.30:
- be able to analyze packets live from network
- auto creation of DescL\d
  => ipDst in IPv4 should be taken from DescL3 ipDst
  => nodesc in Frame avoids the auto creation of DescL\d
- StreamTCP.pm StreamUDP.pm Stream.pm
- endianness test:
  $is_big_endian    = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
  $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;

0.40:
- performances: change all occurances of ->accessor to ->{accessor} (use fields or "Pseudohashes")
- performances: perldoc Benchmark
- performances: use fields; ($pseudohash = fields::phash(foo => "FOO", bar => "BAR");)
- performances: perldoc -q faster
- performances: see file:///home/USER/ebooks/80s/books/perl2/advprog/ch08_01.htm
  for efficient object storage
- performances: perldoc -q memory (using substr or vec as object container)
